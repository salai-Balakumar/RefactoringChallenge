# Technical Challenge

### Database setup
Please follow the instruction to download and setup Northwind DB for SQL Server here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases

### API Requirement
The current functionality works, but could be better. Using your knowledge of OOP Principles, Design Patterns and Unit Testing, your priority is to refactor this source code to make it more maintainable and testable.

#### Guidelines
- Feel free to use any framework and library you want
- Make it concise, readable and correct
- If you would have made a different design decision for production, then comment or document it
- We love high-value unit tests which test the right things!
- We are more interested in your design decisions, code layout and approach (be prepared to explain this).
- Please upload your code to github (either public or private) then invite [nguyenminhkuoc@gmail.com]()

#### README.md
Please describe all information in the file README.md:
- How to run it (don't assume anything is already installed)
- Anything you'd do differently for a production API

#### Bonus
- Dockerfile
- Include your git history
